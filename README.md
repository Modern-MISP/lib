## Getting started

Clone the project and install Python version `3.11.0`. It is recommended to install Python by using [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation). Then install all dependencies by typing `make setup` into your terminal and start the development server using `make dev`.

## Setting up your IDE

Be sure to use the newly created virtual env as your interpreter (`./venv/bin/python`). Also install the [Ruff](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/integrations/) extension for your IDE and set `Ruff` as your default code formatter. It is recommended to activate formatting your code on every save.
